            <h3>City of Mist Website</h3>
            <p>Used HTML and CSS to build a website from scratch. The website is an archive for a TTRPG ran with my friends. 
                This was only for personal use, so I had room to be creative and customize the site at my own pace. 
                Through this project, I learned a lot about web development and gained understanding in cloud based platforms.
                This website is hosted on AWS, and I had the opportunity to be an AWS user.

            <h3>League of Legends Win Probability Prediction</h3>
            <p>A very simple decision tree that predicts the win probability of a League of Legends game based on the first 10 minutes.
                I was curious to how the win probability is determined by the overlay in pro League of Legends matches, 
                so I was inspired to build my own prediction model as practice.
