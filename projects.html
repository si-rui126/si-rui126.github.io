            <h3>Web Scraping Indeed Job Postings</h3>
            <p class="subtext">Languages/skills: Python, BeautifulSoup, web scraping</p>
            <p>I used the package BeautifulSoup to scrape data frome Indeed. Through this project, I got experience with website scraping APIs, HTML parsing, and data cleaning. 
                I was also pleased to discover that being familiar HTML and CSS was helpful in understanding page structure so that means I didn't self-teach myself those for no reason. 
                Who knew knowing web development languages came in handy in statistics?
                This project is still in progress, but I'm excited to analyze the data I've extracted.

            <h3>Clinical Trial Tracker Dashboard</h3>
            <p class="subtext">Languages/skills: R, R shiny</p>
            <p>The program tracks the progress of a clinical trial. 
                The program takes in datasets as input and categorizes patients by groups specified by the biostatisticians. 
                Since the program is intended to be used by biostatisticians and medical writers who may not have much experience with programming, I built a dashboard with a user friendly UI to expand 
                the scope of users.
                In addition, the names of variables are not standardized across datasets, so the dashboard adapts to the input and automatically offers the existing variables as options in a 
                dropdown menu.</p><p>
                (Note: The image is not of the actual dashboard, since I'm not allowed to directly share it.)

            <h3>City of Mist Website</h3>
            <p class="subtext">Languages/skills: HTML, CSS, Javascript, cloud computing platforms</p>
            <p>Used HTML and CSS to build a website from scratch. The website is an archive for a TTRPG ran with my friends. 
                This was only for personal use, so I had room to be creative and customize the site at my own pace. 
                Through this project, I learned a lot about web development and gained understanding in cloud based platforms.
                This website is hosted on AWS, and I had the opportunity to be an AWS user.

            <h3>League of Legends Win Probability Prediction</h3>
            <p class="subtext">Languages/skills: Python, Decision Trees, Machine Learning</p>
            <p>A very simple decision tree that predicts the win probability of a League of Legends game based on the first 10 minutes.
                I was curious to how the win probability is determined by the overlay in pro League of Legends matches, 
                so I was inspired to build my own prediction model as practice.
