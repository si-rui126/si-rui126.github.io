    <h1>About</h1>
    <p style="width: 75%">Hi, My name is Marian Lu, and I am an Applied Statistics M.S. student at California State Long Beach. 
        I'm interested in data science, machine learning, and AI. 
        I did my undergrad at the University of Minnesota with a BS in Architecture and a minor in Statistics. Pretty crazy 
        career pivot, huh? But I realized that I always like creating things, whether it's designing floorplans or building regression models. 
        In my free time, I like to draw, play TTRPGs and League of Legends, and recently, design websites. I'm not very good at any of those though.</p>
